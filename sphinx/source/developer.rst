Build/install
-------------
To build the module::

    python setup.py build

This will copy all the python files into the ``build`` directory (and may do other things).

To install::

    python setup.py install --user

This will install into ``.local`` in your home directory.


Tests
-----
There are two types of testing done with this project. Unit tests, which test if the individual pieces work, and functional tests, which test if the peices work together

.. _unit:

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unit Tests are located in the tests/ directory.

To check test coverage (i.e., how many lines of code are actually hit by the tests)::

    python-coverage run test_all.py
    python-coverage html
    firefox htmlcov/index.html

Of course, instead of ``test_all.py``, you can specify the name of the module you want to test.

.. _functional:

Functional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Located in testDB/ is a functional test. The goal was to have the simplest test of dbprocessing so testing is quick and complete without having to use real data.

Level 0 files are just simple words stored in testDB_{set}_(first|sec).raw format.

Level 1 files are the concatenated versions of level 0, stored in testDB_{set}.cat format.

Level 2 files are rot13â€™d versions of the level 1 files, and are stored in testDB_{set}.rot format.

``testDB/scripts/runThisThing.sh`` will excute the needed scripts to run the entire dbprocessing chain.

Documentation
-------------
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation is stored in the ``sphinx`` directory.

``Makefile`` is used to build the documentation.

Run ``make html`` in the ``sphinx`` directory to build the html documentation, output is in ``build/html``.

``build`` contains the built documentation (and intermediate files); it can safely be deleted.

``source`` contains the ReStructuredText source files; note that a large quantity of the documentation is not built from here but from the Python source files. ``source/autosummary`` contains the docs extracted from those source files; it can safely be deleted. If anything's weird about the docs generated from the Python source, try deleting ``autosummary`` first and then rebuilding. The ``autosummary`` docs are extracted from the version of the module in top-level ``build``, i.e., run ``python setup.py build`` before generating the documentation.

Repository organization
-----------------------
top-level
~~~~~~~~~
There should be(but there totally are) no committed files at the top level besides ``setup.py``, and ``.gitignore`` (not normally visible).

build
~~~~~
This is used by ``setup.py`` in the build/install process; it is ignored by git. Don't hand-edit anything under here; can be safely deleted.

dbprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Source tree for the main ``dbprocessing`` module. If it's in this directory, it's meant to be installed.

Documents

gui

OneOffs

scripts
~~~~~~~
Scripts meant to be called from the command line that should be installed with the module. They should be added to the ``scripts`` list in ``setup.py`` and documented in :doc:`scripts` (source file ``scripts.rst``).

FastData
~~~~~~~~

Multiday file handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project needs a way to pass more than just "today" and "yesterday" to the codes.

Adding "previous" and "next" columns to the product process link may be a way of handling this("previous=2" would mean "to make a product of date 2018-01-15, hand in 2018-01-13 and 2018-01-14 of the input product as well at 2018-01-15" and "next=1" would put in 2018-01-16.)

newest_version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The column is not actually kept updated. Currently it works just by comparing version numbers, but it needs to decided if the column should just be removed because it's unused, or if work should be done to keep this field updated.
