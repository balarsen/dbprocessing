test_DB
=======

What this is:
-------------
The goal here is to have the simplest test of dbprocessing so testing is quick
and complete without having to use real data. Level 0 files are just simple
words stored in testDB_{set}_(first|sec).raw format. Level 1 files are the
concatenated versions of level 0, stored in testDB_{set}.cat format. Level 2
files are rot13â€™d versions of the level 1 files, and are stored in
testDB_{set}.rot format.


How to run this:
----------------
Eventually, this will be a full unittest suite and will simply be run that way,
but for now scripts/runThisThing.sh will execute the needed scripts to run the
entire dbprocessing chain.
